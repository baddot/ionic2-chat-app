# ionic2-chat-app

Ionic 2 chat application using socket.io. Server side in Node.js (Type Script)
uses Expess and store  data in PostgreSQL database.

### Work in progress

You can login into application or register a new account. Once you are logged in
you can search for users and add contacts (search for users, send invitations
and manage received and send invitations).

For test purpose there is a public chat channel where you can send and receive
text messages.

I will add more functionality to it (users groups, private channels, group channels,
writing messages to database).
